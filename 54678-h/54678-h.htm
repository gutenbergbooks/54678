<h2 id="chap1">CHAPTER I
<span class="smaller">MY SURPRISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>
I am going to tell you something that you must
never tell any one. Stupid people wouldn’t
believe it, anyway; and there are so many stupid
people that I should seem like the greatest fibber in
the world. But if you will keep still I will confide
in you.
</p>

<p>
Once on a time, I was in Japan in a city called
Takoshima. It rained buckets full. I was thoroughly
disgusted, and not being able to walk about the streets,
decorated with lanterns and weathercocks, and through
the gardens full of flowers, I had to stay shut up in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
little room sitting on the floor, for in Japan they don’t
use chairs.
</p>

<p>
I kept yawning like a dog in front of a fire.
</p>

<p>
Trying to forget how tedious it was I began to poke
into all the corners of the room, hoping to discover
something with which to amuse myself. After a
thorough search, all I found was a box of matches.
For lack of anything else to do they might help me to
pass the time, as I could place them in all sorts of
positions, and make any number of interesting designs.
</p>

<p>
In the box, however, there were only three, and you
know with three matches even a genius can’t make
anything but a triangle, the simplest of all the figures
in geometry.
</p>

<p>
After all, I might try to make a little man. I had
learned that game long ago when I wore short trousers
and went to school, and always had my pockets stuffed
full of marbles, pens, peach stones, buttons, twine and
other precious things—sometimes even matches.
</p>

<p>
With patience and a little string I used to tie them
together and make arms and legs, and so transform
them into a very slim person that seemed to me
altogether lovely.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
</p>

<p>
I began to work, and in a quarter of an hour the
three matches had become the little man that I
remembered; and I can assure you, he still looked to
me extremely fine.
</p>

<p>
First he was very bold, with arms and legs stretched
out in the position of a fierce warrior. Then I changed
him into a calm and civilized person, and made him
sit down on his box, and then began to hold an old
time conversation with him.
</p>

<p>
“Good-morning, little match<a class="tag" id="tag1" href="#note1">[1]</a>; how are you?”
</p>

<p>
I suppose that you are surprised that a man of my
age could still amuse himself with this game. But
you know a man is always a boy when he is all by
himself and lonely. If you look over the manuscripts
of illustrious scientists and celebrated writers, you will
see here and there the same kind of scribbling and the
same little drawings that they made in their copy
books when they were boys and didn’t want to write
their compositions.
</p>

<p>
The little match naturally greeted my advances with
dignified silence. When I was young and talked to
my toys, I made up their answers too, and so it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
possible to hold long and animated discussions. But
in these days my imagination is worn out. After a
few minutes, my little man looked to me like nothing
but a match, and I thought I had better use him in
the way I was accustomed to. I put a cigarette in my
mouth and holding out my hand I said to him:
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill16"></a>
  <img src="images/ill16.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
“Dear little match, I will now strike your head
and....”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
</p>

<p>
But I got no further. The little man moved, and
falling on his knees held out his hands as if in
prayer.
</p>

<p>
I was very much surprised, and examined him carefully
on every side. I had made a great many little
men just like him, but I had never seen any one of
them move by himself. I looked to see if there was
anywhere a bit of string that I had pulled without
meaning to. But no, I found nothing. The little man
remained quite still in his new position, until at last
I was reassured. I thought the jar of some one passing
outside, or a puff of air had thrown him from the
box, he was so slim and light. I sat him up again and
watched him closely.
</p>

<p>
After a few minutes I saw distinctly that he moved
himself. For some time he trembled very slightly,
then he held out his arms, and slowly rose to his feet.
I could hear a tiny voice, which seemed to come from
him, but it was so feeble that compared with it the
voice of a cricket would sound like a trombone.

</div>

<p>
I leaned toward him, so that I almost touched
I him with my ear and, still uncertain, I said to
him:
</p>

<p>
“Did you speak?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” said the voice, about as loud as a needle
piercing a cork.
</p>

<p>
“What did you say?” I asked.
</p>

<p>
“I was so afraid you might burn me up.”
</p>

<p>
I was stupefied. You understand why. It was all
so unexpected. I didn’t in the least know what to
say to him, but the idea of a match that was afraid of
being burned up made me laugh.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t laugh,” he exclaimed. “I am a Haji.”
</p>

<p>
“A Haji!” I repeated.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I was the Haji of an old willow.”
</p>

<p>
Ah! now I understood. Everything was explained.
Certain trees in Japan are inhabited by Genii which
are like our fairies, and are called Haji. Only we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
have no more fairies, and Hajis still exist, because
Japan is much younger than our countries. When
a country grows old it
loses all its fairies, magicians
and incantations.
But how could a Haji
ever leave his woods,
and his flowers, and become
a match, with the
risk of being destroyed to light the cigarette of a
foreigner?
</p>

<div class="figleft"><a id="fill22"></a>
  <img src="images/ill22.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
“Why are you here?” I asked.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I lived so happily for two hundred and fifty
years on the mountain Karniyama in the province of
Noto! Now they have cut down the woods up there.”
</p>

<p>
“Why?”
</p>

<p>
“Judging from the conversations I overheard, they
needed the wood for railroads. From the soft wood of
trees like me they made matches. Look at all that
remains of my beautiful willow! Look at me! Just
to think, I once had branches ten arms long; and with
my roots I could drink from the fountain of Tashira,
which was fifty feet away.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
</p>

<p>
“What shall I call you, poor Haji?” I asked impetuously.
</p>

<p>
“Call me by the name you have already given me.”
</p>

<p>
“Fiammiferino?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, Fiammiferino.”
</p>

<p>
“Let’s say Fiam then, for short.”
</p>

<p>
With this he put out the little sticks of which his
arms were made, and caressed the lobe of my ear and
asked timidly:
</p>

<p>
“You are my friend, aren’t you?”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly,” I replied, much moved.
</p>

<p>
“You won’t burn me, will you?”
</p>

<p>
“Never.”
</p>

<p>
“If you take care of me, I will live with you, and
serve you—and I am able to.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I will take care of you.”
</p>

<p>
“I was powerful, respected, and venerated in the
woods. I had a beautiful voice, and sang when the
wind swayed my branches. Now I am so different—but
I can be useful to you and help you. I know
many things. I can see a long distance, and I know
the world, and can give you advice and information,
and tell you old stories when you are sad. I promise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
to be affectionate and faithful. Now I will try to
walk.”
</p>

<p>
With a stiff step and unsteadily, as if he were
walking on stilts, Fiam took a trip around the room
and then returned and
climbed up on my knee.
</p>

<p>
“Is it all right?” I
asked.
</p>

<p>
“Tighten up the joint
of the left leg. The
knot is loose so the leg
is trembly.”
</p>

<p>
With the help of my
teeth I tightened the
knot, and placed Fiam
on the floor. He tried
again, and this time
stepped more quickly
and steadily.
</p>

</div>

<p>
“Thank you,” he said
to me, as he came back. “Now, listen to me. You
must carry me always with you; you must never
leave me; you must never give me to any one else.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Don’t be afraid. I shall put you in your little
box. That will be your home. Does it please you?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, although I have suffered so much in there,
constantly afraid of being put to death. If I hadn’t
been found by you....”
</p>

<p>
“Thank you, my friend.”
</p>

<p>
“And when you put me in there wrap up my head
in cotton; have you any?”
</p>

<p>
“No. Let me see; wait. I will take some from the
quilt. Will that be all right?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; I’m so afraid of taking fire, you see. Imagine
how scared you would be if your head were covered
with phosphorus like mine.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t speak of it. I can imagine it very well. It
makes me shudder to think of it.”
</p>

<p>
“Look out for fire, then. Don’t mix me up with
others; I mean with ordinary matches. Never smoke
in my presence.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no, I promise you, I won’t.”
</p>

<p>
“Now put me away; I need a little rest. All this
has made me tired. Good-night.”
</p>

<p>
“Good-night, little match.”
</p>

<p>
I covered his head with a tuft of cotton which I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
took from the quilt on my bed, and placed my friend
in the wooden box, on which was printed the picture
of a dragon surrounded by Chinese words which meant
“Matches made in Sweden.”

<h2 id="chap3">CHAPTER III
<span class="smaller">HE CONFIDES IN ME</span></h2>
</div>

<p>
In this way I came to have a new companion and
dear confidant with whom I lived happily for
many months. I soon became accustomed to him, but
I must own to you that during the first two or three
days, when I wasn’t looking at him, I still thought it
all a dream. As soon as I had put him to rest I went
to sleep myself (the noise of the rain was so soothing),
and when I awoke I was so sure that Fiam was a dream
that I forgot him entirely. But the little boy was
near me on the floor and before long I heard rapid
tapping on the thin wooden sides. Fiam was knocking.
</p>

<p>
I opened his prison, and out he came. He took the
cotton from his head carefully, so as not to break the
phosphorus, and sat down on top of a slipper that was
near him.
</p>

<p>
“Glad to see you,” I said.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Thank you,” he replied in his feeble voice.
</p>

<p>
As I leaned toward him he shouted at me:
</p>

<p>
“Put me on your white wall;
we can talk then more easily.”
</p>

<div class="figright"><a id="fill30"></a>
  <img src="images/ill30.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
“What wall?” I asked,
looking all around me. “I
don’t see any.”
</p>

<p>
“I mean the battlement
that defends your neck. Put
me on top of that. I shall be
near your ear.”
</p>

<p>
Then I understood what
the little match meant. The
walls of the Japanese fortresses
are painted white, and he had
taken my collar for a bulwark
to defend my neck. I explained,
and put him astride
of the collar.
</p>

<p>
“You are right,” he said to me as he sat serenely on
the edge. “I find now that it isn’t a wall. But you
see I don’t know what is little and what is big. I am
so small myself that I can’t make things out. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
seem to me larger than Fuji-Yama, the sacred mountain.”
</p>

<p>
We began to chat. He talked so well that I listened
enchanted. I already loved him. It gave me pleasure
to feel on my neck the light touch of his little leg and
the caress of his wooden arms on my ear calling my
attention when he had something important to tell me.
This little trick of his was the cause of some unfortunate
incidents.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally when I was absent-minded and thinking
of something else, I would feel my ear being tickled
and I would wave my hand as if brushing away an
insect, and that would throw poor Fiam to the floor
from a height that was really dangerous to him.
</p>

<p>
That first day, sitting astride the “battlement,” he
gave me some confidences. He told about his past so
sorrowfully that it made me very sad. It was the only
time Fiam ever entertained me with the story of his
life in the tree; but if I should live a thousand years I
could never forget a single word of it.

<span class="smaller">ABOUT A STORK AND A BATTLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>
This is what he told me.
</p>

<p>
“My father was the geni of a maple tree.
My mother was the spirit of a birch tree. They died
of old age when their trees withered. I was lively
and vigorous. My tree was the first one to get its
leaves in the spring and the last one to lose them in
the autumn. I always tried to be faithful, and after a
hundred years I hadn’t a single dry branch, so attentive
had I been in keeping my tree in good condition.”
</p>

<p>
“Isn’t it tiresome to be a tree and always stay still
and be quiet?” I interrupted.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no. I played with the wind, which would
swing my branches, and I amused myself with the
birds that came to me by the hundreds, and made their
nests among my leaves. I was just a hundred and
fifty years old when the quiet of the woods was broken
by a great event. But I am afraid I am tiring you.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no, go on, please tell me.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Listen, then. One evening in May, a wonderful
evening, my friend the stork arrived. He was always
traveling around, and
when he passed by the
mountain Hamiyama he
never failed to rest himself
on my third branch
toward the east. He was
called To. He brought
a lot of news from the
other mountains and
from the plains across
which he had flown in
his travels. This evening
while he was still
far off, he stopped in the
air, poising on his wings,
and looking about for his
favorite branch began to
cry, ‘Mikara! terrible
things are happening.
It is a miracle that I am still alive.’
</p>

<div class="figright"><a id="fill36"></a>
  <img src="images/ill36.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
“‘What is the matter?’ I asked.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
</p>

<p>
“He sat down, arranging the feathers on his breast,
smoothing them with his beak, and all out of breath
replied, ‘Horrors, I have escaped from the midst
of a cloud of arrows which flew hissing about me.
Brrrr...!’”
</p>

<p>
Fiam paused, absorbed in his thoughts. Anxious to
hear the rest, I said earnestly:
</p>

<p>
“And who shot the arrows?”
</p>

<p>
“Exactly the question I asked To.
</p>

<p>
“‘Who? The men!’ replied To. ‘The valley is full
of soldiers, who are fighting with bows and arrows,
with lances and spears. There is war! They are killing
each other; they pursue, they shout, they gallop
on horseback; they are covered with shining armour.
A great castle is burning, and all around the ground
is covered with the dead. Listen,’ added To, as he
scratched his head with one of his long claws, as he
always did when he was thinking. ‘I must leave you.
Don’t be offended if I don’t pass the night with you.
I must go farther on. Not that I am afraid, you
know, quite otherwise, but it is best to be careful.
Lances and spears don’t frighten me, but arrows—you
never know. Adieu, Mikara,’ and he drew in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
claws and stretched his wings and swept away into
the air just like an arrow himself, without giving me
time to say good-bye. He said he wasn’t afraid, but
really he was trembling. Never believe in the courage
of any one who boasts of not being afraid.”
</p>

<p>
“And weren’t you afraid?” I asked Fiam.
</p>

<p>
“To tell the truth, I wasn’t any too brave. I kept
thinking about the castle on fire. My father had
often told me, when I was a little tree, that in war
men burned the woods in order to drive out the
enemy. If the war came near me and the woods were
burned, poor me! You can imagine how anxiously
I waited. I listened all night. When the wind blew
I held my branches still so they wouldn’t make a noise.
At midnight a cuckoo came. As he was a good friend
I begged him to keep quiet.
</p>

<p>
“‘I can’t,’ he said; ‘it is my duty to call “Cuckoo,
cuckoo” a thousand times every night. That is my
work. But if it will give you any pleasure I will go
to another part of the mountain,’ and so he did. The
night passed peacefully. The dawn came, and
then....”
</p>

<p>
“I beg of you, don’t stop. What happened at dawn?”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
</p>

<p>
“At dawn I heard some noises here and there. I
raised my leaves to listen better and heard the sound
of animals in flight.
</p>

<p>
“I waited to see some of them and to ask questions,
and pretty soon out of a hole came a family of boars;
father, mother and two sons. I didn’t love wild boars;
they are worthless and badly educated beasts that often
came around to clean their tusks on my trunk, stripping
off all my bark, but this time I forgot all about
my hatred and tried to welcome them by holding out
a branch. The father boar tore off some leaves and
went on without even saying thank you, and all the
family followed grunting.
</p>

<p>
“By good luck, soon after, a roebuck came along.
‘What is happening?’ I whispered to him. He
turned panting, and held up one ear, all anxiety, and
replied:
</p>

<p>
“‘They are coming here.’
</p>

<p>
“‘Who?’
</p>

<p>
“‘Armed men,’ he said and scampered away.
</p>

<p>
“‘And I must stay here,’ I thought.”
</p>

<p>
“Poor little match man!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes. If I had only been able to fly. Even a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
mosquito can defend himself, but a willow, even if he
is large and has lived a hundred and fifty years, can’t
protect himself from any peril. It is terrible!”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed it is.”
</p>

<p>
“But to go on. Not long after I heard a cautious
step and a rustling among the shrubs. My leaves
shivered all over when I saw approaching—guess
what!”
</p>

<p>
“A ferocious wild beast.”
</p>

<p>
“Worse! I saw a man coming.
</p>

<p>
“‘This is the first,’ I said to myself. ‘Now others will
come—they will set fire to the woods, and I shall die
tortured in the flames.’ And my leaves shook even
harder, as if there had been I don’t know what kind
of a wind.
</p>

<p>
“But no more men came, and I began to calm myself
and to look about coolly. This man was very handsome,
and dressed all in silver armour. He was so exhausted
he could hardly walk. It seemed to me he
left drops of blood behind him. He breathed hard.
He stumbled over tufts of grass, he fell and rose again
and went on staggering. Where he fell the grass was
covered with blood. I am telling the truth when I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
say I forgot my own danger, I was so full of pity for
him.”
</p>

<p>
“Good for you, Fiam!”
</p>

<p>
“At last he fell, close to my trunk. I looked at
him. He was very young. The armour on his breast
was broken. He took off his helmet, which was tied
with a red cord under his chin, and laid his head
against me to rest better. The sun had risen and I
gave some shade to the wounded man. Some time
passed, but I don’t know how long it was when I heard
a distant noise.”
</p>

<p>
“Was it the others?”
</p>

<p>
“Wait. I heard the sound of arms, of steps, of voices.
Little by little the tumult drew nearer. It came
from all sides. It filled the woods. And the young
warrior also heard it. He rose slowly to his feet, and
stood immovable, leaning against me listening.
</p>

<p>
“Suddenly a voice shouted, ‘Haiya, Hay!’ a kind of
hurrah. A hundred voices from every side called
‘Haiya!’ and the first said, ‘Come, I have found
traces of his blood! Let us follow it! Hay!’
</p>

<p>
“The other voices howled, ‘Haiya’ with so much
eagerness and satisfaction that I thought they were all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
friends and followers of this unfortunate young man,
happy to find him to save him, and care for him. So
little did I know about men.”
</p>

<p>
“And weren’t they friends?”
</p>

<p>
“Far from it! The first voice said, ‘He can’t
escape us any longer! He is our prisoner!’ The others
echoed, ‘He is ours. Haiya!’ They were enemies
looking for him, do you understand? He heard them.
He knelt down and bowed his head calling on
Amaterasu, the god of the sun, the god who made
Japan. Then he took off his armour and bared his
chest, which was covered with blood, and put his hand
to his side to find the hilt of his sword. I saw at once
that he didn’t wish to fall alive into the hands of his
enemies, and I decided to save him.”

<p>
I was so astonished at what Fiammiferino said that
I threw up my hand in amazement, and came
near sending him flying with his legs in the air.
</p>

<p>
“You,” I cried. “How could you save him?”
</p>

<p>
“I twisted the end of one of my branches around
the hilt of his sword to attract his attention, and then
I spoke to him.”
</p>

<p>
“How could you speak to him?”
</p>

<p>
“You know each Haji is allowed to reveal himself
three times during his life. This was my first time.
I whispered:
</p>

<p>
“‘Wait.’
</p>

<p>
“The young man turned and bowing politely exclaimed,
‘Honorable Willow! may you live ten thousand
years! I perceive that you are a Haji and my
friend, although I have done nothing to deserve your
kindness. Thank you for it, but you must let me
die. You know what a disgrace it would be for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
soldier to fall alive into the hands of his enemies. I
must conquer or cease to live. You would not wish
to have me dishonored.’
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill46"></a>
  <img src="images/ill46.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
“I replied: ‘I desire above all things your honorable
salvation. Keep near my trunk and don’t move.’
</p>

<p>
“He obeyed, and I surrounded him with branches,
covering him all over with leaves, and interlacing
my boughs in a tangle so thick that it would have
been impossible to see him or get at him without first
chopping off every branch with a hatchet.”
</p>

<p>
“How about the enemies?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, the enemies arrived. There were ever so
many and all around. They brandished their glistening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
swords and lances, and shouted, ‘He is here, he
is here.’ Guided by the drops of blood, they came
directly to me. I must confess I was frightened, not
for myself but for him. I strained every joint as
much as I could and looked around. The one who
seemed to be the leader pointed to me with his sword
and said:
</p>

<p>
“‘The tracks of blood end here, but he can’t be hidden
in this thicket; not even a bird could get through
it. It isn’t possible for him to be here; we must look
somewhere else.’ And the disorderly crowd walked
off among the stubble and scrubbly trees thrusting
their swords here and there as if they were after
game.”
</p>

<p>
“So the warrior was saved.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I saved him. I raised my branches and
showed him the fountain of Tashira, in which he
could bathe his wounds, and told him where he could
find some healing fruit. He stayed near me for two
days. At night he slept at the foot of my trunk.
When I heard suspicious noises I called him and put
my branches around him as a mother would do to a
child. The third day he said to me, bowing low:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
</p>

<p>
“‘Generous and beloved willow, I must leave you.
I am a prince; my name is Funato. My enemy has
attacked me with his army, burned my castle and
confiscated my property. But I must return to my
people and save them from further perils. I must
protect them. I shall never forget what I owe to
you. You will be adored by me and my people as
long as we have life.’ And dressed in his armour, his
helmet on his head, his sword at his belt, he walked
away, turning every few steps to look back as long as
he could see me.”
</p>

<p>
“And you?”
</p>

<p>
“I waved my branches to salute him, and from far
away he could see me swaying and bowing. No
tempest ever shook me so hard. I was very sad
and not ashamed to weep.”
</p>

<p>
“Dear little Fiam; and have you ever seen him
again?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, listen. Exactly a year later, the stork who
always stopped to rest on my branch passed by again.
</p>

<p>
“‘How are things going?’ I asked him.
</p>

<p>
“‘I am in a hurry,’ he answered, scratching his
head.

“‘Oh, oh!’ I observed. ‘Arrows in the air?’
</p>

<p>
“‘Not yet,’ he exclaimed, ‘but there are armed men
near here. I am obliged to look after some business.
Good-bye,’ and he flew away.
</p>

<p>
“There were really men in arms in the vicinity.
Imagine my surprise when I saw Prince Funato
appear at the head of his soldiers and a great number
of servants all dressed in holiday clothes. They surrounded
me, they saluted me, they knelt about me,
they burned incense to me under my branches. They
had brought food and saki, which is their wine made
of rice. For two days they had a great festival.
Beautiful songs were sung in my honor by their musicians.
They poured saki on my trunk. I drank so
much that I wanted to dance, and to tell the truth, if
I could have walked I am afraid I should have reeled.
Fortunately I was a tree and no one discovered my
condition. On the third day they returned to the
valley.”

<p>
I soon learned to feel so much affection and admiration
for Fiam that even now I never light a
match without thinking of him.
</p>

<p>
“Was that the end?” I asked him.
</p>

<p>
“No; every year at that date in May there was a
festival in the wood. You see, I had become a god to
these people; they adored me. But as the years passed
the festival grew very sad. The men became old. The
army dwindled away. The musicians lost their voices,
and each year the songs were slower and feebler.
Prince Funato’s hair turned white, then his back was
bent, then he came up the mountain leaning on a cane,
then he was carried on a litter, and then he came no
more.
</p>

<p>
“The first year his followers returned without him;
they wept as they burned incense under my boughs.
Funato was dead. From that time the pilgrimage was
more and more melancholy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Fifty years after the battle there were left only one
musician, two servants and nine soldiers. At the end
of another year, that day in May, only one man came.
He looked as if he were a hundred years old. He
could hardly drag himself along. He laid his wrinkled
forehead against me and murmured:
</p>

<p>
“‘Honorable Willow, we shall never meet again.’
</p>

<p>
“After that I saw no one; I was forgotten. How
could I tell what men were doing in the valley? But
I am tiring you with all these old memories.”
</p>

<p>
“Fiam!” I exclaimed, after a few minutes of silence,
“I not only love you, but respect you. You have
done some beautiful things in your life.”
</p>

<p>
“But think what I have come to be—a match!”
</p>

<p>
“Tell me how it happened.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, some years passed; then one day I heard
voices and the sound of axes in the woods, and I saw
that companies of men were chopping down the trees.
This work lasted for months. Near me there was another
Haji living in a beautiful elm half-way up the
mountain. One evening I heard the crash of a great
tree falling, and in the midst of the noise I could hear
the voice of my friend, who called out to me:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
</p>

<p>
“‘Farewell, Mikara.’
</p>

<p>
“I looked over the tops of the trees. He was gone,
and I never saw him again. The next morning a man
passed near me, looked at me and, with a brush soaked
in paint as red as blood, he made on my trunk the
words that mean, ‘To be cut down.’
</p>

<p>
“I shook my bark in the way horses shake their
skins to drive away flies, hoping to make those horrible
words drop off, but I didn’t succeed. Some days later
a group of ragged men arrived with axes; they read
the words and fell upon me.”
</p>

<p>
“And what did you do?”
</p>

<p>
“I? In that moment of danger I revealed myself
for the second time. You know, I told you that Hajis
could make themselves known three times. I shouted,
‘Stop!’”
</p>

<p>
“And did they?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, for an instant. They listened and I repeated,
‘Stop!’ They laughed and said it was an echo. I
don’t know what sort of a thing an echo is. Once on
a time when we heard a voice in the wood we all knew
it was a Haji speaking. Now they say: ‘It is an
echo,’ and laugh.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
</p>

<p>
“And they cut you down?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, indeed, they cut me down. They worked a
whole day. They took me first into the valley; next I
felt myself carried quickly by a monster that spit fire.”
</p>

<p>
“The train.”
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill56"></a>
  <img src="images/ill56.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
“Call it that, if you like. I was taken into a great
house where there was another monster that cut the
trees in sheets.”
</p>

<p>
“A sawmill.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Call it that if you like. I was cut into eight hundred
parts, and each part was caught by iron jaws,
swallowed and spit out, turned into thousands and
thousands of little sticks, all exactly alike. A real
army of sticks, whole regiments, were put at one time
into a suffocating bath, from which they came out
with phosphorus heads.
</p>

<p>
“At last they were shut up in little boxes, and then
they were piled in pyramids in an immense room.”
</p>

<p>
“A store.”
</p>

<p>
“Call it that if you like.”
</p>

<p>
“And what became of you?”
</p>

<p>
“You know that a Haji before dying can take refuge
in whatever part of the tree still remains. So I passed
from box to box. As the boxes were packed in larger
boxes and carried away, I went from one to another of
those that remained.
</p>

<p>
“At last the pyramid became very small; only a
hundred and forty-four boxes were left. They were all
put together and I was carried to this city. The boxes
were sold one by one. I lived in the last, in this one
where you found me. All this time I had before me
the picture of the frightful end that awaited me. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
first when I realized that my power, my peace and
happiness were over, I supposed I should still live, so
imagine my terror when.... It makes me crazy
to think of it.”

<p>
“Poor little thing!” I exclaimed. “Do tell me
more.”
</p>

<p>
I was anxious to hear the end of this story, with
which I had sympathized so much.
</p>

<p>
“Well, then at last even my box was sold. I don’t
know whether it was daytime or night, for shut up in
there I knew nothing about time. I felt myself all
shaken up; a little later the box was opened and two
big fingers fumbled around inside and rudely grasped
one of the sticks, which in this last store I had heard
called matches. Then: tric, trac! the head of the
stick was struck violently against the side of the box
and ffroo! it burned. I jumped with horror and
waited anxiously as the little stick was consumed by
its own flame between the big fingers. I understood
everything at once. This was my destiny!”
</p>

<p>
“You suffered horribly, eh?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh! I passed days and nights in agony. Every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
four or five hours the box was opened and one of my
matches was taken out to its death. Each time I hid
among the lower sticks till, at last, there remained only
three. I resigned myself to my dreadful end and began
to count the hours of my life. By this time I
knew that all my tree, my beautiful tree, with branches
ten arms long, was all burned, fibre by fibre, and had
absolutely vanished. It was no use to struggle.”
</p>

<p>
“Why didn’t you try flight?”
</p>

<p>
“How? What could I do? How could I open the
box? And if it was open how could I fly without
legs? If I had only had these legs that you have made
for me! But enough of that! By chance the box was
forgotten and laid where you found me. And you
have saved me. I am your faithful servant forever.
To you I am revealing myself for the third and last
time.”
</p>

<p>
“Fiam, you are my dearest friend.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you know what the most evil thing in the
world is?”
</p>

<p>
“No; what?”
</p>

<p>
“Those monsters that cut, and split and destroy and
change, those new monsters that once didn’t even exist.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
</p>

<p>
“The machines?”
</p>

<p>
“Call them that if you like. They are merciless.
They devour the most sacred and ancient beings to
make things to sell. They respect nothing.”
</p>

<p>
“But, my friend, you are not able to judge.”
</p>

<p>
Fiammiferino pinched my ear furiously and howled
in a voice that sounded like a whistle, it was so loud
and shrill:
</p>

<p>
“Don’t contradict me. You must be careful, you
know, for if you make me angry I may take fire.”
</p>

<p>
I quieted him, talking as gently as I could. I was
sorry he had such an inflammable temper, but I suppose
the phosphorus was largely to blame.
</p>

<div class="figleft"><a id="fill64"></a>
  <img src="images/ill64.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
I can’t tell you how many other intimate conversations
I had with Fiam. When we were alone he
always sat astride of my collar, and I usually let him
sit there when I was working and writing. I must
tell you that he gave me excellent advice, made suggestions,
and explained Japanese affairs to me. I shall
even have to own that more than once my success as a
journalist at this time was due entirely to Fiam, but
for pity’s sake don’t mention it to any one.
</p>

<p>
He often left his post of observation on the battlement,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
and came down onto my necktie, which he
called “the silk waterfall.”
There he read what I wrote
and gave me his opinion
with a frankness that would
have made me very angry
if I hadn’t been so fond
of him. Sometimes in the
midst of a sentence I would
hear his little voice shrieking:
</p>

<p>
“Oh, what stupidity!
What have you written?
Throw it away. I can’t understand
a word of it.”
</p>

<p>
At this interruption I
would stop writing and say:
</p>

<p>
“What is that?”
</p>

<p>
And he would go on:
“Rub out that nonsense. I
will tell you what to say,
and you can put quotation
marks.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Don’t you want to sign it, too?” I asked, laughing.
</p>

<p>
But I agreed to what he proposed, and was always
satisfied with what he did. In the end I accepted his
services absolutely.
</p>

<p>
“Fiam,” I would sometimes say, “I am tired. I
don’t feel like thinking. Tell me what to write.”
</p>

<p>
And he would shout at me: “Lazy fellow, if I
weren’t here what would you do? Well, just this
once” ... and he would dictate page after page.
</p>

<p>
Dear little Fiam, how good he was!

<span class="smaller">FIAM GOES TO THE WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>
Fiam had been with me about a month when I
was ordered to go to the war.
</p>

<p>
You know, this was just the time when a great war
had broken out between Japan and another empire,
and I was ordered to go out and describe what I saw
there. While writing up the important events that sent
two armies to the front I couldn’t stop to narrate the
adventures of my little friend, and so I never put a
word about Fiam in any of my writings. Besides,
grown people are so incredulous!
</p>

<p>
The war took place in a part of China called Manchuria.
In order to get there you have first to travel
by railroad to a seaport, then on a ship to China, then
on horseback or afoot, crossing plains and mountains
for about a hundred miles, and so to the field of battle.
</p>

<p>
In telling his story Fiam had shown so much fear of
war that I hadn’t dared to tell him where we were
going. He fairly flooded me with questions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
</p>

<div class="figright"><a id="fill70"></a>
  <img src="images/ill70.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
“Why do we travel so much?” he asked me one
day in the train when I had put him up on my collar
so that he could see the country
out of the window. I made
him look at it well so that he
could give me a description of
it, as, in fact, he did.
</p>

<p>
“We are traveling to amuse
ourselves,” I replied.
</p>

<p>
“Beautiful amusement,” he
grumbled, “to be carried by
this monster spitting out smoke.
It seems to me like going back
to that great house where I was
split up and cut to pieces. Look
up there,” he added after a few
moments. “What lovely country!
See the roof of that temple
through the trees, and that wonderful
field of flowers. Let us
stop here.”
</p>

<p>
“We can’t.”
</p>

<p>
“Why not, if we are traveling to amuse ourselves?”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Yes, but the amusement will come further on.”
</p>

<p>
Fiam gave a soft whistle—it was his way of sighing.
Then he crept down on my shirt to find the silk waterfall
and rest a while in a fold; but he couldn’t find any
tie. I was wearing a kind of uniform similar to that
of the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
“Why are you dressed this way?” he asked in a
surprised tone, tapping me on my chin.
</p>

<p>
“It is the fashion in my country.”
</p>

<p>
He whistled again, and going down from button to
button he reached my knees.
</p>

<p>
“Why do you wear these great boots?” he said,
looking down at my feet, stretching himself out
cautiously as if he were an Alpine climber hanging
over a precipice.
</p>

<p>
“It is the fashion in my country.”

<p>
The train stopped at a large station. A dozen
officers entered the car all talking, threw their
bags into their racks, took off their swords and placed
them near the window, seated
themselves and lighted their
cigarettes. There was a perfect
slaughter of matches. Poor
Fiam was so frightened that he
hurried under my waistcoat
and, creeping near a buttonhole,
hid his head under a button.
</p>

<div class="figleft"><a id="fill75"></a>
  <img src="images/ill75.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Outside of the train there was
the noise of a great crowd. We
could hear the tread of the
troops as they went to their
places in the cars prepared for
them. We heard shouted commands,
the rattle of cartridges
in their boxes at the belts of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
soldiers, and the guns dropping to the ground all at
once sounded like falling iron. In the distance
hundreds of people kept shrieking and repeating:
“Sayonara!” which means good-bye. “Banzai,” hurrah.
“Come back victorious! Destroy the enemy!
Glory!” and other similar cries.
</p>

<p>
One of the officers in my compartment asked:
</p>

<p>
“What are we waiting for?”
</p>

<p>
“They are attaching the cars of guns,” replied another.
</p>

<p>
“There will be lots of guns needed in this war!”
exclaimed a third.
</p>

<p>
“It is going to be the greatest war of our country,”
a fourth added complacently.
</p>

<p>
Some one began to hum a tune. The others joined
in the chorus. The train started. I felt Fiam, who
had taken his head from under the button, climb
along the waistcoat and crawl into his little box,
which was in an inside pocket. The box had been
used so much that it was all broken on one side, so
that Fiam had learned to come and go through the
hole by himself.
</p>

<p>
He didn’t appear until late at night, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
every one was asleep, swaying with the motion
of the train, and the car only dimly lighted by
a covered lamp. I was awakened by his little
voice. He had climbed up on my shoulder near
my ear and was calling to me. In the dazed condition
of a person half awake I thought it was
the singing of a mosquito and put up my hand to
catch him.
</p>

<p>
“It is I,” he said. “I am Fiammiferino.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh! good-morning. Aren’t you asleep?”
</p>

<p>
“No, I never sleep. I am not a man.”
</p>

<p>
“Then if you will excuse me, allow me to sleep. I
am a man.”
</p>

<p>
“First tell me—from the conversation I have overheard
I judge there is war; is it true?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, perfectly true.”
</p>

<p>
“And are we going there?”
</p>

<p>
“Does it displease you?”
</p>

<p>
“No, but it displeases me that you haven’t been
frank with me. Am I not your friend?”
</p>

<p>
“I believe so.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I forgive you; don’t say anything more. I
will go anywhere with you. They talked of war in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
my country. If I could only do something to help
them to conquer.”
</p>

<p>
“You!” I exclaimed laughing. “Then aren’t you
afraid?”
</p>

<p>
“No. I am afraid of nothing but fire; and you will
protect me.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, of course.”
</p>

<p>
“And you will always tell me the truth?”
</p>

<p>
“I promise you.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s all. Good-night.”
</p>

<p>
I could have kissed him if it were only possible to
kiss a match. He disappeared. At that moment some
one shook me. It was one of the officers who looked
into my eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Are you awake?” he asked me.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” I replied, sitting up.
</p>

<p>
“Are you feeling sick? I am the army surgeon;
my name is Tasa. Let me feel your pulse.”
</p>

<p>
“But I am perfectly well.”
</p>

<p>
“No, you are talking to yourself, and must have
something the matter with your head.”
</p>

<p>
“I assure you I am perfectly well.”
</p>

<p>
“Show me your tongue.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Not if I know myself,” I replied irritated.
</p>

<p>
“All right,” concluded Dr. Tasa; “calm yourself.
I see you are armed. I think it would be best for you
to give me your revolver, and for you to put a little ice
on your head.”
</p>

<p>
“But I am not in the least crazy.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, well,” and his little yellow face wrinkled up
as if to say, “Who knows?”
</p>

<p>
“I wasn’t talking to myself,” I said in order to convince
him.
</p>

<p>
“With whom were you talking?”
</p>

<p>
“With Fiam....” I didn’t finish, for I remembered
my promise not to reveal his presence to
any one.
</p>

<p>
“Humph, humph!” He shook his head and murmured,
“Quiet yourself, and don’t think anything
more about Fiam. Go to sleep; we shall see to-morrow.”
</p>

<p>
The next morning I pretended to leave the train,
and changed cars in order to escape the watchfulness
of Dr. Tasa.
</p>

<p>
The journey went on without incident. I didn’t
dare to have Fiam come out during the day, as I was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
never alone. But at night he took a walk on my
shoulders, and we held whispered conversations.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill80"></a>
  <img src="images/ill80.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
On board the steamer on our way to China we had
more liberty, and often conferred together. After our
work was put away in an envelope, Fiammiferino began
looking for a postage stamp in the depths of the portfolio.
He went in and traveled all about the leather, explored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the little pockets, and came out with amazing
dexterity. He had a passion for putting on postage
stamps after I had wet them. He walked over them,
carefully pressing the edges flat with his feet to be sure
they would stick fast to the envelope; when he had
finished this operation, which he did as carefully as an
upholsterer laying a carpet, he always danced a ballet
to express his satisfaction in his completed work.

<p>
One evening—it was the night before we were
to land—the officers with us were polishing
their swords, trying to make them like mirrors. In
order to enjoy themselves while they worked they had
had saki brought, and invited me to drink with them.
As they drank they sang. Then they put their swords
in their scabbards and went to sleep. I was about to
follow their example when I felt Fiam moving.
</p>

<p>
He had come out of his box, and was walking energetically
about on my chest. I unbuttoned a button on
my waistcoat and called to him: “Fiam!” I forgot to
tell you that sometimes he didn’t like this nickname that
I had adopted. He felt as if he had lost half his name,
and would show his disapproval by completing the
word.
</p>

<p>
“Fiam!”
</p>

<p>
“Miferino!” he added.
</p>

<p>
“What do you want?”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
</p>

<p>
“What do I want?” he replied excitingly, stepping
outside with an agility I had never observed in him
before. “What do I want? How delightful! I
smell saki, and you left me shut up in the box.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, what of it?”
</p>

<p>
“Saki, sakii, sakiii,” he began to sing, dancing
around on my shoulder.
</p>

<p>
He was beside himself with excitement.
</p>

<p>
“Be careful,” I said, “or you will fall off.” I had
never seen him so lively.
</p>

<p>
If Fiam had one fault it was that of being melancholy.
Sometimes I scolded him for it.
</p>

<p>
“In this world you must be resigned,” I would say.
“It is true you are no longer a beautiful willow in the
woods, and I am sorry for you, but that is no reason
for being so sad, and for grumbling all the time about
everything and everybody.”

  <img src="images/ill86a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FIAM BEGAN TO DANCE</p>
</div>

<p>
“But you don’t understand, my good friend,” he
said now, “that the odor of saki, this delicious perfume,
reminds me of the most delightful time of my
life. When Prince Funato came with his court every
year they poured saki on my trunk. I loved it. It
made me want to dance. It is more than a hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
years since I smelled this marvelous odor. I beg you
to put me near the cup.”
</p>

<div class="figleft"><a id="fill87"></a>
  <img src="images/ill87.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
I did so. The cup of saki from which I had drunk
was as small as a doll’s cup. It was beautiful blue china
with white dragons and was still half full of the good
warm liquor which was something like Marsala wine.
</p>

<p>
Fiam began to dance around on the brim as children
do on the edges of fountains
in gardens. Then he leaned
over and stirred the liquid.
I could hear him singing in
his mosquito voice.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the dry wood
of Fiam’s arms absorbed the
saki, which rose through the
fibres till it reached his head. Then he indulged in
the craziest antics. At last he took a little run and,
turning a magnificent somersault, plunged into the cup.
</p>

<p>
I realized it all too late. I was perfectly distracted
when I heard Fiam splashing in the saki, spinning
around quite like a top. I drew him out and held him
between two fingers to dry, but I couldn’t keep him
still. He was so wet he slipped away and skipped about,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
leaving drops of liquid everywhere, and if I held him
tight he pricked me on the nails and kicked desperately.
</p>

<div class="figleft"><a id="fill88"></a>
  <img src="images/ill88.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Taking a good hold I raised him
up so as to look at him near by.
The phosphorus on his head had
melted and shone palely through my
fingers.
</p>

<p>
“What have you done?” I said.
“A little more and you would have
been drowned.”
</p>

<p>
“Who are you?” he answered,
trying to make his voice heavy.
“Who dares to place mortal hands
on the body of a god? Let me
down, barbarian,” and he twisted
around. “Let me go or my vengeance
will annihilate you! You are
a coward! I will try the effect of my
divine power! Tremble....”
</p>

<p>
I saw now what was the matter
and whispered:
</p>

<p>
“Fiam, be good.”
</p>

<p>
“Shame on you! I am a Haji.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Yes, but you are also acting disgracefully. Let me
put you in your box and to-morrow you will thank
me.”
</p>

<p>
“You want to lock me up. You want to make me
a prisoner. You aren’t satisfied to have me for a servant
to carry around with you everywhere. You are
the cause of all my woes, but my power is infinite. At
a call from me all the animals in the world will come
and tear you to pieces. My friend To, the Stork, will
come and eat your eyes out. The Prince Funato will
come and cut your head off with his sword.”
</p>

<p>
“Fiam, keep still; you are not used to wine. Don’t
you see that if I were really your enemy I should
light you, and burn you to the tips of your toes? I
think I will now smoke a cigarette....”
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill89"></a>
  <img src="images/ill89.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
These words quieted him, and in a little while I put
him in his box and placed that in my pocket.

<p>
The day after that we arrived in China.
</p>

<p>
Far out at sea we spied the land—all green
hills with pagodas everywhere.
</p>

<p>
In the morning, not feeling Fiam move, I looked
for him in his box, but it was empty, and he had disappeared.
I was very anxious. There was no trace
anywhere of my little friend except an odor of saki.
I was afraid he had fallen on the ground and that
some one had picked him up. Every time I saw a
lighted pipe or cigarette my heart beat and I ran to
see if the burning match could be Fiam. I couldn’t
bear to leave the ship until I had found him. I actually
ransacked my pockets ten times in succession. I
looked in every corner of my valise, all over the floor
and in every crack of the deck and in my slippers—nothing.
I was afraid he had run away and I could
have cried from grief.
</p>

<p>
“What have you lost?” asked one of the stewards,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
seeing me bending over searching on the floor and
stairs.
</p>

<p>
“I am looking for a match,” I answered.
</p>

<p>
“Here is one.”
</p>

<p>
Startled, I turned quickly, but he handed me an
entirely fresh box of matches.
</p>

<p>
“No, thank you,” I said. “Mine is double.”
</p>

<p>
He gazed at me in amazement and left me. If he
had been the doctor he might, perhaps, have ordered
ice on the head; but as he was only the steward he
returned soon and gave me the bill for my meals.
</p>

<p>
I drew out my purse to pay him, and on opening it
I saw a lot of papers. I looked between them feverishly.
Just guess! Fiam was among the postage
stamps, but in what a state!
</p>

<p>
While still wet with saki he had left his box and,
without knowing what he was doing, had crept among
the stamps, because that way was familiar to him. Of
course, the glue on the stamps had stuck to him, and
the more he struggled to free himself the stickier he
became. Then the saki had dried, leaving him all
covered by a collection of stamps. Think how he
looked! On his legs he had two blue five-cent stamps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
and three red one-cent each; on his chest there were
two red and one yellow. On his arm was another of
one cent.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill95"></a>
  <img src="images/ill95.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
He was dreadfully humiliated, and asked me to help
him get rid of them.
</p>

<p>
I carefully stripped off those on his back, but he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
begged me to leave some pieces on rather than scrape
them off with my penknife. So from this time Fiam
wore a garment as gay as a clown’s. All over him
you could recognize little pieces of the face of the
Emperor whose likeness is on all Japanese stamps.
</p>

<p>
Fiam was very proud of this costume on account
of those fragments of the Imperial face.
</p>

<p>
“With this protection,” he said, “I can accomplish
wonders.”
</p>

<p>
“Look out,” I told him. “Your suit has cost me
more than twenty cents. What if I should wipe your
coat off and put on a Chinese stamp to punish you?”
</p>

<p>
At this he was very angry. And when he was
angry he had a queer way of getting even with me.
He would say:
</p>

<p>
“All that I told you to write is false, absurd and
stupid; it is exactly opposite to the pure and simple
truth.” After that he wouldn’t speak for two hours.
You can see that he was really dreadfully provoked.

</div>

<p>
Twice more during that long journey I thought
I had lost Fiam. Each time it was on account
of that hole in his box through which he crawled out
to ramble, and which he couldn’t always find on his
way back.
</p>

<p>
One morning in a Chinese village, where I had
passed the night, just as I was mounting my horse to
ride out to the army I discovered that Fiam had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
I looked everywhere, especially among my postage
stamps, but couldn’t find him.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon as I lay under a tree in the stillness
of a deserted field I thought I heard his little
voice.
</p>

<p>
“Fiam! Fiam!” I called.
</p>

<p>
I could make out the response distinctly:
</p>

<p>
“Miferino! Miferino!”
</p>

<p>
As I was warm I had taken off my waistcoat to use
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
as a pillow as I lay stretched out. The voice came
from that.
</p>

<p>
I fumbled around until I found him shut in between
the lining and the cloth. I pulled him out and greeted
him effusively.
</p>

<p>
“How did you ever get there?”
</p>

<p>
“I have a habit of going out at night.”
</p>

<p>
“A very bad one.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, what do you expect me to do? I don’t
sleep. Last night I went out as usual. Your watch
near my house made such an abominable noise, tic,
tac! It was like a blacksmith’s forge. Never mind.
I went out and took a trip over your clothes.”
</p>

<p>
“Over my clothes?”
</p>

<p>
“Exactly; you had thrown them on the floor, and
they made a beautiful landscape.”
</p>

<p>
“A landscape?”
</p>

<p>
“Surely. All in a heap they looked like mountains
and valleys, ravines, plains, precipices and grottoes—all
kinds of things. It was a great pleasure to travel
all over it. I climbed up and slid down. I sat on
round things like immense tubes.”
</p>

<p>
“They were folds.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill101"></a>
  <img src="images/ill101.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
“I know it, but your folds are gigantic to me. As I
went around I discovered the entrance to a cave. I
went in. It was a long tunnel where I had to crawl
on all fours. When I got half-way in I wanted to turn
around; but I couldn’t, for my hands and feet got
caught in the folds, so I had to go forward.”
</p>

<p>
“I see; you were in one of the sleeves.”
</p>

<p>
“When I came out from the tunnel, I discovered a
great opening with a shed over it. I entered and found
a cavern full of paper.”
</p>

<p>
“It was a pocket.”
</p>

<p>
“I traveled around until I found a little hole I could
scarcely squeeze through.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, yes! My pocket is a little ripped.”
</p>

<p>
“I was now in a large and empty, wearisome place,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and when I wanted to get back I couldn’t find the hole
through which I entered. Imagine my suffering!
After a while I felt you take up the clothes and put
them on. I screamed as loud as I could, but you
didn’t hear me. I knew that you were looking for me,
but I could do nothing. But, at last, you heard me
and I am saved.”
</p>

<p>
“I say, Fiam....”
</p>

<p>
“Miferino!”
</p>

<p>
“You ought to promise me not to go out at night or
I shall be obliged to make you an iron house and shut
you up for a hundred years. Just think, if I lose you
the first person who finds you will burn you up without
giving you time to say, ‘Ouch!’”
</p>

<p>
He promised. But a few days later he was gone
again.

<p>
This time I was sure I should never find him.
I went three whole days without seeing him.
Every evening I shook my clothes, uselessly repeating
my search. I would have given ten years of my life,
and paid a large sum of money, to have found him.
I blamed myself for not having looked thoroughly;
perhaps I had left him on the ground among the
coarse Chinese mats of the house in which I had
passed the night.
</p>

<p>
On the third evening, having a little spare time, I
started to develop some instantaneous photographs that
I had taken during the journey.
</p>

<p>
To my immense surprise Fiam appeared in every
picture, or rather his shadow, thrown across each
landscape. It was evident that Fiam was shut up
inside of the camera. I opened it and called inside:
“Fiam!” holding it near my ear.
</p>

<p>
“For pity’s sake help me!” It was his little voice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
beseeching. “Take me out of this!” He was so
desperate that he had forgotten his usual correction of
“Miferino.”
</p>

<p>
“Come out yourself.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t. They are holding me by the leg.”
</p>

<p>
“Who are?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know who; please help me.”
</p>

<p>
I looked and saw my friend held by one foot caught
in the spring of the box. It was not easy to get him
out. His foot was broken, and when I put him on the
table he limped.
</p>

<p>
“What were you doing in there?”
</p>

<p>
“That awful place,” he whined.
</p>

<p>
“But how did you get in there?”
</p>

<p>
“You left the door open and I wanted to see what it
was like. I went in.... What a horrible place!
Pitch dark, and every now and then a deafening noise
and blinding flash, then grinding wheels. I had to
look out or I should have been completely crushed.
There wasn’t a safe corner. At last my foot was
caught.”
</p>

<p>
“Now,” I said seriously, “you can’t live any longer
in your little house. It is for your good. You may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
live inside of this.” I showed him my silver cigarette
case. “You will be comfortable and live like a lord.
You see the inside is all decorated.”
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill107"></a>
  <img src="images/ill107.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
When he saw the decoration he was resigned, and
wanted to see how he felt in his new home which he
called the imperial tomb.
</p>

<p>
To make up for depriving him of his liberty at
night, I found him a good place to spend his days
when he was near me. I put him in the ribbon of my
hat; only his little black head stuck outside. He saw
everything at enormous distances, and always told me
what he had discovered as if he were watching from
the bridge of a ship.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
</p>

<p>
“There is a city,” he called one day.
</p>

<p>
“How far off?”
</p>

<p>
“Twenty miles.”
</p>

<p>
“Is it large?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, and full of soldiers.”
</p>

<p>
Then I knew we had reached the army, and were
getting into the region of the fighting.
</p>

<p>
Fiam had a passion for the top of my hat, which he
called the cupola. When I was alone, traveling on
foot through the country, observing the position of the
armies from a distance, he asked me to let him walk on
the brim, which he called the balcony, and then he
went around, keeping near the crown so as not to
fall off.

<p>
I don’t know how he managed it, but he understood
the manœuvres of war better than I. You
see, Hajis are unusually intelligent. Often I couldn’t
make out what was going on. I could see soldiers
running, firing, apparently turning back, cavalry
galloping, and could hear the roar of cannon on all
sides, yet I couldn’t tell how the battle was going.
But he explained everything to me.
</p>

<p>
“Look there at that hill. Do you see they are
attacking? Look to the left; that is an assault.
There are ten thousand men. Bravo, advance!” He
would get wildly enthusiastic, running here and there
and shouting orders in his squeaky little voice, screaming
encouragement, reproof, praise and blame. You
ought to have heard him calling: “Reënforcements to
the right! Place two batteries behind that hill! Forward
with the reserves! Smash their entrenchments!”
He seemed to think himself the general.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
</p>

<div class="figright"><a id="fill112"></a>
  <img src="images/ill112.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
I often relied entirely on him for information. I
put my hat, with him on it, on the branch of a tree or
on top of a cane and went tranquilly to sleep near my
horse browsing in the grass. When I awoke I called:
</p>

<p>
“Fiam, who is winning?”
</p>

<p>
“If you are awake,” he answered, “we will go and
send a telegram to your journal.”
</p>

<p>
Then I would put him in the hat band, mount my
horse and gallop away to the nearest military telegraph
station.
</p>

<p>
We had many curious expressions.
He could never understand
firearms. The discharge
of muskets he called
little thunder, and that of
cannon big thunder. He
thought that men really
hurled thunderbolts. When
I tried to explain to him about
guns and cannon he would respond:
</p>

<p>
“All right! All right! But the fact is that these
machines which work with that thing you call powder
are nothing but factories of thunderbolts of various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
sizes, and we can prove it, because we see and hear
both the lightning and the thunder.”
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill112a"></a>
  <img src="images/ill112a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“WHO IS WINNING?”</p>
</div>

<p>
Another of his ideas was that the telegraph was
nothing but a Haji. For him it was a live Haji in a
copper wire that carried the messages. He spoke of it
as “my brother of the wire.”
</p>

<p>
I tried to tell him about it: “But no, dear Fiam.
This time it is really a thunderbolt that carries the
message.”
</p>

<p>
“Truly!” he exclaimed sceptically. “And where is
the lightning, where is the thunder? I should think
that you would admit that I, a Haji, understand such
things a little better than you.”
</p>

<p>
The telegrams that he dictated to me and that I had
to alter in private, usually began this way: “Brother
of the wire, go and say to our friends in Europe and
America that to-day after four hours of big and little
thunder, etc.”
</p>

<p>
Seeing him so infatuated with fighting, I said to
him once:
</p>

<p>
“It appears to me, Fiam——”
</p>

<p>
“Miferino!”
</p>

<p>
“That you love war!”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Not at all. Do you think any one could love
slaughter?”
</p>

<p>
“But you think of nothing else!”
</p>

<p>
“That is true. This is a question of my country, so
I would like to be a soldier and fight with all my
strength. I swear to you I wouldn’t mind dying.
Just think that the future of the country for centuries
and centuries, its prosperity and greatness, depend
upon our victory. Hurrah for the war!”
</p>

<p>
“Brave Fiam, you are a good citizen.”

<p>
One day when we were far away from our post
there was a great storm. It rained cats and
dogs, and the brim of my hat dripped all around like
an overflowing gutter.
</p>

<p>
I walked through the wood with my head bent forward,
completely forgetting Fiam, who was fastened
to the band of the crown and was soaked through and
through. After many hours I reached my tent. I
took off my hat and pulled out Fiam, whom I placed
on a blanket, knowing how he loved to climb around
the folds. But to my dismay I saw that he didn’t
move. He stayed just as I had put him; flat on his
back, with his arms stretched out and one leg in the
air. He looked as if he were dead.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill117"></a>
  <img src="images/ill117.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Fiam!” I called frightened. “Fiam, my friend,
speak to me.”
</p>

<p>
But he was quite still.
</p>

<p>
“He is dead, he is dead!” I exclaimed, almost with
tears in my eyes. “The rain has killed him, and it
is all my fault. I was so cruel to forget him.” I
continued to call, “Fiam, come back. Forgive me!
Fiam!”
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me as if I had lost a brother of whom
I should have been careful and should have protected
better. I was overcome with remorse. I thought of
all the delightful times we had had together, of his
kindness, of his courage, of the work we had shared
and of our sincere friendship.
</p>

<p>
“Fiam, Fiam!” I called, now and again, hoping to
hear once more his little affectionate voice.
</p>

<p>
At last I thought of trying a radical way of reviving
him if there were still the tiniest hope.
</p>

<p>
I took a flask of saki which I had had on the ship
and dropped a little on Fiam. Then I put a wad of
cotton (which I kept handy in case it was needed for
wounds) in the cigarette box; then put my friend on
the cotton, as if he were in a beautiful white feather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
bed, shut the box and put it near the fire, which I
lighted as best I could in the midst of my small
shelter.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill119"></a>
  <img src="images/ill119.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
When I again opened the box and looked in, he
was lying there immovable, his arms stretched out
and his little leg raised up.
</p>

<p>
“Fiam!” I called.
</p>

<p>
No answer. I closed the box and waited, and am
not ashamed to say that I waited in tears. At last
after about an hour had passed, during which I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
looked in for the hundredth time, I jumped for joy.
His little voice had answered.
</p>

<p>
But it was a tiny voice, even smaller and feebler
than usual. I asked him no end of questions most
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
“Speak. What is the matter? How do you feel?
What can I do for you? Tell me—why don’t you
move?”
</p>

<p>
“Why,” he replied faintly, “because the water has
swollen my joints.” That was it. The dampness had
enlarged the wood and shrunk the thread in such a
way that the little fellow couldn’t move ever so
slightly.
</p>

<p>
“But you ought to have told me at once,” I said
to him reprovingly and in an affectionate tone.
</p>

<p>
“I couldn’t. I was suffocated by the melted phosphorus.
Now I begin to feel stronger.”
</p>

<p>
“Wait a minute; I will put you near the fire again,
and when you are comfortably dry you will be as well
as you ever were.”
</p>

<p>
“I am so afraid of the flames! Shut up the imperial
tomb, and don’t put me too near the fire,” he
warned me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Just keep quiet.”
</p>

<p>
Three hours later Fiam was completely cured of his
cold, and walked carefully, like a person on stilts,
around the house.
</p>

<p>
But a queer thing had happened. You remember
that after the incident of the postage stamps Fiam
had always been covered with little gummed pieces of
paper showing parts of the Emperor’s face in different
colors. The rain had softened the gum, and when he
was put in the cotton to dry it had stuck to him, and
with all my attempts to get him free I was unable
to succeed, so that now my companion was completely
covered with thick down, a kind of white fur coat,
which made him look like a miniature automobilist.
</p>

<p>
I proposed to shave him with my razor, but he opposed
this energetically.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t do it!” he said. “In the first place your
razor frightens me. I see that you can’t even shave
yourself without cutting your chin, and one of those
slips would cut me in two. Then I like this fur; it
is becoming. It makes me look bigger, you know
how thin I am, and it protects me from bad weather.
Let it be.”

</div>

<p>
After this to protect Fiam whenever we went
out in bad or threatening weather, I covered
him with a magnificent waterproof made from the tin-foil
I had taken off of some chocolate. I wrapped him
up well, and I can’t tell you how proud he was to see
himself clad in silver like an ancient
prince in armour. I put a
cap made of the same material on
his head, which was exactly like a
microscopic medieval helmet.
</p>

<div class="figleft"><a id="fill125"></a>
  <img src="images/ill125.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
In this outfit Fiam was a little
clumsy at first, but soon he could
move with ease, and at last he was
able to walk. He was never ready
to take off the brilliant suit, and
even when the sun shone gloriously he would say:
</p>

<p>
“Put on my waterproof; the weather is threatening.”
</p>

<p>
“It doesn’t seem so to me.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes. I feel the dampness in my joints.”
</p>

<p>
I indulged his little vanity and made him happy.
But he glistened so brightly that a Japanese officer
once asked politely:
</p>

<p>
“What is that you wear in the band of your hat?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, nothing,” I replied evasively; “a little pencil.”
</p>

<p>
Also I noticed that the general who commanded the
troop looked at me curiously, but said nothing, because
he was afraid it was beneath his dignity.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time I had been with the general.
It was the day before a battle, and he had invited me
to breakfast in a tent as large as a house, where all the
superior officers ate, and where a military band played
all the time as loud as it could.
</p>

<div class="figleft"><a id="fill126"></a>
  <img src="images/ill126.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
During the whole meal I could feel
Fiam moving around.
</p>

<p>
“Is he crazy?” I thought. “He
will surely be seen.”
</p>

<p>
Several hours later when I was alone
again I stood him on a piece of paper,
and he began to caper and jump, so
that he made holes in the paper.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Look out!” I exclaimed. “Has the smell of the
saki gone to your head?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, but something beside saki!” he shouted,
standing still. “I am the happiest being in the
world! I have seen him again! I have found him,
his own self.”
</p>

<p>
“Who?”
</p>

<p>
“The prince Funato.”
</p>

<p>
“The one you shielded from his enemies in the
wood?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes, yes.”
</p>

<p>
“But you said he was dead.”
</p>

<p>
“Well then, precisely, so I did. He died ever and
ever so many years ago.”
</p>

<p>
“What then?”
</p>

<p>
“And then—oh, it is too beautiful—he has come
back to life!”
</p>

<p>
“Fiam, you are laughing at me.”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed I’m not.” And he began to shout, ecstatically
happy: “I have seen him again, himself, his
very self!”

<p>
When he began dancing around again I caught
him by the leg and held him still.
</p>

<p>
“Explain yourself,” I commanded.
</p>

<p>
“Put me astride your collar, and I will tell you.”
</p>

<p>
“All right; now talk.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you remember I told you Prince Funato died
an old man? And every year at the anniversary of
the battle where I had protected him by my branches”—(here
Fiam gave two of those sighs of his that
sounded like whistles, and observed sadly, “What a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
beautiful willow I was then!”) “he came to find
me?”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed, I remember perfectly.”
</p>

<p>
“Very well; his spirit has entered into one of his
descendants.”
</p>

<p>
“That is only a Japanese superstition.”
</p>

<p>
“So you foreigners say; you also think that the
Haji is an old Japanese superstition. You have told
me so, and yet you see that I really exist.”
</p>

<p>
“That is true. I beg your pardon.”
</p>

<p>
“There is no harm done. Now I have met the man
who has the spirit of Prince Funato.”
</p>

<p>
“And who is it?”
</p>

<p>
“The general.”
</p>

<p>
“Not really.”
</p>

<p>
“It is he who is the descendant of the prince.”
</p>

<p>
“How did you find it out?”
</p>

<p>
“I am a Haji, and can see things that men can’t.”
</p>

<p>
“And does the general know it?”
</p>

<p>
“No; the spirit never remembers its former life.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh,” I smiled.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t be so sceptical. You ought to have more
faith in me. I can tell you something else.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Go on, tell it.”
</p>

<p>
“Did you see that tall, serious, gray-haired colonel,
with a beautiful beard, seated at the right of the
general?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I think so.”
</p>

<p>
“Colonel of the big thunderbolt?”
</p>

<p>
“The artillery——”
</p>

<p>
“If you like. Well, he is the old warrior that
climbed up the mountain alone the last time to greet
me. He trembled all over from age. I remember he
leaned up against me and said:
</p>

<p>
“‘Honorable Willow, we shall never meet again.’”
Another little whistle showed me that Fiam was much
moved by his recollections.
</p>

<p>
By this time my European ideas were pretty nearly
turned upside down. “What if Fiam should be
right?” Two days later I called on the general with
the pretext of thanking him for the excellent breakfast
of moist bamboo roots that he had given me. I wanted
to question him skilfully.
</p>

<p>
I found him with knitted brows bending over a
map. Every once in a while he gave an order to some
officer, which was received and obeyed in silence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
They were coming and going very solemnly. We
could hear the tramp of horses arriving and departing
outside the tent. Far off the cannon roared.
</p>

<p>
After an exchange of compliments I risked asking
the question which was on the tip of my tongue.
</p>

<p>
“General,” I said, “among your ancestors was there
one called Funato?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” he answered, with some surprise, but with a
smile of satisfaction; “Prince Funato Matabaci.”
</p>

<p>
“And after a great battle was he not pursued by an
enemy until he was saved by the Haji of a willow?”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, ah!” laughed the general. “I see you are up
in the legends of the country. I am glad to hear it.”
Then ceasing to laugh, he added: “The fact is that
Funato Matabaci went to war with Nitoba Riocito, and
in great fright he hid in a wood. All the rest is
legendary, and the fancy of an ignorant and credulous
age.”
</p>

<p>
Later when I told this to Fiam he was sad and very
much hurt.
</p>

<p>
“Well,” he said, “let’s see. Look at the blessings
you have brought us from the West. Those lovely inventions
that chop down, split and cut poor willows in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
pieces. These are your beautiful ideas. The most
sacred things are only legends to you.”
</p>

<p>
“Fiam, I am....”
</p>

<p>
“You—you are a stupid....”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, thank you.”
</p>

<p>
He couldn’t make me angry with his insults, for
after all I thought he was quite right. Some minutes
passed in silence, then Fiam went on:
</p>

<p>
“But it doesn’t matter. I love him just the same.
It isn’t his fault that he denies me. To me he is still
the Funato that I protected as if he were my son, and
I promise you I shall never fail to guard, defend, and
save him, even if it takes my life.”
</p>

<p>
“But what can you do, poor Fiam?” I asked, much
interested.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, who knows? who knows?” and he sighed
sadly.

</div>

<p>
Although the fortunes of war turned out for
the benefit of Japan in general, this was not
the case with the troops among which I found myself.
</p>

<p>
When I had seen the general studying the map so
intently I had concluded that he had good reason to be
so serious. Frankly, I understood very little of what
was going on, but Fiam knew all about it perfectly,
and he didn’t always explain it to me, because he said
it was dangerous to tell everything to foreigners by the
Haji of the wire. But I felt from his looks that important
events were taking place.
</p>

<p>
He was restless. He seemed to be cherishing a
secret sorrow. During the fighting, while he watched
from my hat, he was beside himself with excitement
and ran around the brim crying:
</p>

<p>
“No, no! The great thunder to the right, the little
thunder to the center! Quick! Whatever are they
doing! To the right, I said. Stop! It is a mistake.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
</p>

<div class="figright"><a id="fill140"></a>
  <img src="images/ill140.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
But he wouldn’t tell me of what error he was speaking.
To me it seemed as if things might be going very
well. The enemy was withdrawing into a mountainous
region, and we followed them without hindrance.
What more could
be desired?
</p>

<p>
The mountains
grew nearer and
nearer. As we approached
them we
came to a deep valley,
long and dark,
which from a distance
could be seen
swarming with the
enemy in the midst
of clouds of dust
raised by the cannon, by the baggage and the columns
of marching soldiers.
</p>

<p>
One evening, after Fiam had been shouting “Halt!”
from every side of my hat, he said to me:
</p>

<p>
“Listen. I will tell you an important secret. If we
enter that valley we are lost.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
</p>

<p>
“Truly,” I observed doubtingly.
</p>

<p>
“Immediately. This whole division of our army
would be captured. You must run to the general and
tell him to halt here and take the road toward the
right.”
</p>

<p>
“How shall I do it? He wouldn’t listen to me.”
</p>

<p>
“Try it.”
</p>

<p>
“Shall I say that you sent me?”
</p>

<p>
“No, he wouldn’t believe it. Tell him that you
have explored and are persuaded. Do try.”
</p>

<p>
He begged and implored with so much persistence
that at last I decided to please him. I put him in my
hat, mounted my horse and started.
</p>

<p>
I found the general riding in the midst of his guard.
I asked to speak to him alone on a very important
affair.
</p>

<p>
“General,” I said gravely, “if you enter that valley
you are lost!”
</p>

<p>
He stopped his horse, looked at me in amazement,
and broke into a laugh.
</p>

<p>
“Ha, ha, you are joking.”
</p>

<p>
Indeed, I felt a little shaky. I should have liked to
beg his pardon and withdraw in peace, but I knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
that Fiam was listening, and I had unlimited faith in
him.
</p>

<p>
“I am not joking,” I said. “I beg you to believe
that you risk having this part of your army captured.”
</p>

<p>
He looked at me attentively as I went on:
</p>

<p>
“Send out your scouts, and you will be convinced
of it.”
</p>

<p>
Then he replied courteously: “I have sent. The
road is clear. Don’t worry. I think you need to take
care of yourself. At the first stop take a long rest.
Good-bye, and thank you.”
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand to me, spurred his horse, and
rode off.

</div>

<p>
As soon as we were alone I said to Fiam:
</p>

<p>
“You see what a fine figure you made me
cut.”
</p>

<p>
He gave no answer. My request to dictate a telegram
to the newspaper he flatly refused. Half an hour
later we arrived at the encampment. From inside my
tent I heard a horse trotting and then stop. A voice
asked:
</p>

<p>
“May I come in?”
</p>

<p>
“Come in,” I cried.
</p>

<p>
An officer entered. I knew him at once. It was
the surgeon I had talked to on the railroad train.
</p>

<p>
“The general sent me,” he announced. “I am an
army surgeon; my name is Tasa. Let me feel your
pulse.”
</p>

<p>
“But I am very well,” I replied, irritated.
</p>

<p>
“Keep calm. The general’s orders,” he whispered
smiling.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
</p>

<p>
I held out my hand. He felt my pulse, looking at
his watch, then commanded:
</p>

<p>
“Let me see your tongue.”
</p>

<p>
I showed it to him, at the same time making a face.
</p>

<p>
“Facial contraction,” he murmured, and then asked
aloud:
</p>

<p>
“Do you still talk to yourself?”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“With Fiam!”
</p>

<p>
“Let me alone; I am perfectly well.”
</p>

<p>
“No, you are ill, and I must cure you. I order ice
on the head.”
</p>

<p>
“I have no ice.”
</p>

<p>
“But I have some.”
</p>

<p>
He went outside, took a piece of ice from his saddle
bag, placed it on my head, bound it tight and said:
</p>

<p>
“I will return later.”
</p>

<p>
For two days I endured this torture, which gave me
the worst cold I ever had in my life. I vowed to Fiam
that I would never give any more strategical advice to
a general, not if the world perished.
</p>

<p>
The terrible perplexities of my little friend did not
seem to be fulfilled. Indeed, we entered the valley
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
that he dreaded so much and marched steadily a whole
day.
</p>

<p>
There was not even a shadow of an enemy. From
the instant we filled the valley all firing ceased. It
seemed as if the war were over. The advance guard
reported that the region was unoccupied. No more
big thunderbolts and no more little ones. The soldiers
were delighted with this unexpected quiet. We could
hear nothing but the rumble of the marching troops,
echoed by the steep mountainsides. At night the
silence was absolute, only broken by the baying of
dogs from far off and the hissing of the wind on the
crest of the mountain.
</p>

<p>
The valley grew constantly narrower; it was like a
neck—and at last it was merely an immense cleft—a
great corridor of rock, without a roof and with a
narrow exit at the end.

<span class="smaller">FIAM GOES FORTH</span></h2>
</div>

<p>
In the evening of the second day after that I felt
that something extraordinary was taking place.
Every one was grave and preoccupied, and Fiam was
very much excited.
</p>

<p>
“What’s the matter?” I asked him for the hundredth
time. Instead of answering, he said:
</p>

<p>
“Look at me well. Do you think I could still take
fire like any other match? I mean if I should strike
myself against a stone could I set myself on fire?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, of course. But for heaven’s sake, what do
you want to do?” He made me anxious. “Do you
want to kill yourself?”
</p>

<p>
“No, no; don’t be afraid, my friend.”
</p>

<p>
Later on the colonel of artillery, in whom Fiam had
recognized the old warrior, came to my tent. He had
been sent by the general to ask who had warned me
of the danger of entering this valley.
</p>

<p>
“No one,” I replied.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
</p>

<p>
“You were right,” he went on; “we are in danger,
but the spirits of the heroes protect us, and we will
come out all right yet.”
</p>

<p>
“What of the enemy?”
</p>

<p>
“It has shut us into the valley. It seemed best to
come this way because it is the shortest, and appeared
to be free.”
</p>

<p>
“And can’t we get out through the opening ahead?”
</p>

<p>
“That exit is closed. The enemy has buried there
a thousand pounds of dynamite. If our troops pass
over it it will explode.”
</p>

<p>
“Can they blow it up from a distance?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, with an electric wire.”
</p>

<p>
“And can’t we turn back?”
</p>

<p>
“No; the valley is barricaded in the rear. If we
tried it there would be a desperate battle in which
every one would be killed or captured from the general
to the last soldier.”
</p>

<p>
“Couldn’t we climb the mountains?”
</p>

<p>
“They are inaccessible and the enemy occupies the
summit. Listen; they are already firing on us.”
</p>

<p>
We could indeed hear the first guns. The sun had
gone down some time ago; the valley was dark. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
could see the stars and the flash of powder on the tops
of the mountains. Stray balls fell on our unprotected
camp. The soldiers were preparing for battle. They
were digging trenches and cutting down trees to make
defences. All this silently as possible, and in the
dark.
</p>

<p>
I asked the colonel how he knew the exit of the
valley was mined.
</p>

<p>
“Two prisoners told us, deserters from the enemy.”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps it isn’t true,” I exclaimed, but a tiny
voice that I alone could hear said:
</p>

<p>
“It is true.”
</p>

<p>
Fiam, on my collar, had listened to the conversation.
</p>

<p>
I saluted the colonel and went into my tent.
</p>

<p>
I started to light a candle, but Fiam stopped me:
</p>

<p>
“Don’t make a light. If they see a light they may
shoot you in the back.”
</p>

<p>
So we stayed in the dark, and Fiam went on:
</p>

<p>
“Take hold of me. I am on your shoulder. Now
put on my waterproof,” he ordered.
</p>

<p>
“Why?”
</p>

<p>
“It is necessary for me to keep dry.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill154"></a>
  <img src="images/ill154.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
“What are you going to do?”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t lose time. Do as I say. It is for the good
of all.”
</p>

<p>
I reached for the tin-foil that I kept behind a book,
wondering what his words meant. When I had dressed
him he said:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
</p>

<p>
“You wish me well?”
</p>

<p>
“With all my heart.”
</p>

<p>
“Then obey me, and have faith in me. Carry me
outside the tent, walk twenty-five steps toward the
north, then put me on the ground and leave me.”
</p>

<p>
“Toward the north? Be careful—that way lies the
mine they intend to explode under us.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; be quiet—there isn’t a moment to lose.”
</p>

<p>
I was very much impressed by his earnestness and
emotion. I went out, holding him near my face in
my hand and spoke to him tenderly. I felt it to be a
solemn moment.
</p>

<p>
“Fiam, what are you going to do?”
</p>

<p>
“I have already told you that I love him.”
</p>

<p>
“Whom?”
</p>

<p>
“Prince Funato. And that I am ready to protect,
to defend and save him even if it means my death.”
</p>

<p>
“And then?” I asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
“Well, the time has come. I am going to save
him.”
</p>

<p>
“But how?”
</p>

<p>
“I am going to set fire to the mine, and so make a
way out for him and his soldiers. Go back to your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
tent and send this message: ‘To-morrow will be a day
of victory.’ It is the last thing I shall tell you, my
dear good foreign friend.”
</p>

<div class="figleft"><a id="fill156"></a>
  <img src="images/ill156.jpg"
  alt="" />
</div>

<p>
“Fiam, you are crazy. You will never succeed,
never.”
</p>

<p>
“Why not? It will take me seven hours to go from
here to the mine. A man could
go in a few minutes, but my legs
are so short. I shall run. I shall
run faster than seems possible to
you. But I shall be seven hours
at least.”
</p>

<p>
“But the mine is hidden; you can’t find it.”
</p>

<p>
“I can see what a man can’t. I am a match, but I
am also a Haji. I know about the mine; do you
know how? Because I saw it when they were making
it and we were forty miles off. I shall find it easily.
I shall go directly to the dynamite, and light it
myself.”
</p>

<p>
“But you will die,” I said in horror.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, but what is my life compared to that of so
many people and the possibility of victory? Don’t
you think I ought to sacrifice myself?”
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fill156a"></a>
  <img src="images/ill156a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“I PUT HIM ON THE GROUND”</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
</p>

<p>
I couldn’t answer. I was too sorrowful. Suddenly
Fiam said:
</p>

<p>
“Here we must part. Good-bye. Think of me
sometimes. I have cared a great deal for you.”
</p>

<p>
I couldn’t control my tears.
</p>

<p>
“Fiam,” I protested, “let me carry you a hundred
feet further.”
</p>

<p>
“No, it is useless. We must part now. Put me on
the ground.”
</p>

<p>
“Good-bye.”
</p>

<p>
I put him on the ground and leaned down to him.
</p>

<p>
“Fiam,” I whispered, “forgive me if I have tried to
hinder you. You are doing well! Go and succeed.
Your death is more beautiful than a hundred lives.
Some day I shall tell your story.”
</p>

<p>
“Good-bye.”
</p>

<p>
“Good-bye.”
</p>

<p>
I watched him starting off in the dark. His armour
shone white in the light of the stars. He was so tiny,
he looked like a strange little animal traveling between
the stones and over the tufts of grass. Then he
disappeared from sight. My little man—my wonderful
little man—had gone forever.

</div>

<p>
I entered my tent. How awfully alone I was!
I should never find him again in the bottom of
the camera or in the midst of postage stamps! I
should never hear his little voice, prompting me with
“Miferino.” I should never carry him astride the
battlement, or on the crown of my hat. The imperial
tomb was empty except for the white cotton bed!
</p>

<p>
I couldn’t sleep. After I don’t know how long the
moon rose. I got up to look at the clock. It was
midnight. Fiam had been walking four hours. How
far had he gone?
</p>

<p>
The firing continued every now and then. “Little
thunder,” I thought, remembering the queer idea of
my friend. Every few minutes I looked at the clock.
One o’clock passed; two o’clock passed. I was getting
anxious. I thought an hour had gone by—it was five
minutes.
</p>

<p>
At half-past two I began to listen. A quarter to
three, three, a quarter past three——
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
</p>

<p>
I thought he hadn’t found the mine, and I almost
felt glad at the idea that I might see him again.
</p>

<p>
Half-past three. The minutes seemed like eternity.
Twenty-five minutes to four. Twenty minutes to
four——
</p>

<p>
It was (I shall never forget it) at precisely thirteen
minutes to four when the night was lighted by an immense
brilliant blue light. A few seconds later the
whole earth shook and a horrible explosion rent the
air. Then silence.
</p>

<p>
It wasn’t long before the trumpets blew. The camp
was all commotion. Commands were issued, confused
with shouts. These, I made out, were joyful.
</p>

<p>
“The mine has been fired! The mine has been
fired!” they repeated again and again.
</p>

<p>
The ranks formed. The regiments drew up in line
of march. The officers galloped about. The flags were
unfurled.
</p>

<p>
At dawn the columns moved—fresh and eager, as if
starting off for the first encounter.
</p>

<p>
The terrible pass was traversed by the soldiers
singing while the bayonets glistened in the rising
sun. Two hours later we were safely outside the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
mountainous defile, and were joined by the main
army.
</p>

<p>
The enemy was forced to give battle, and was defeated.
</p>

<p>
That evening they all feasted in the general’s tent.
All the officers were happy. I alone was sad.
</p>

<p>
After a while they began to ask, Who could have
blown up the mine? Some one said:
</p>

<p>
“The soldiers sent to explore returned without finding
anything.”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps,” another suggested, “it blew up of itself
on account of poor construction.”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said a third. “It was blown up by the enemy;
they thought we were on the march, near the mine.”
</p>

<p>
I arose and said solemnly:
</p>

<p>
“I know who blew up the mine and made your
victory and escape possible.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell us, tell us!” they shouted in chorus. “Who?”
</p>

<p>
“It was Fiam, who....”
</p>

<p>
“Who is that?” asked twenty voices at once. “Who
is our hero and our rescuer? How did you know
him?”
</p>

<p>
“It is,” I proceeded firmly, “the Haji of an old
willow tree that....” A tumult of laughter greeted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
me. Even the general joined in. They thought I was
joking. The general cried:
</p>

<p>
“Still more legends, ha, ha!”
</p>

<p>
“I am in earnest,” I said, turning to him, and
couldn’t help adding, “It was the Haji of Funato,
your Haji.”
</p>

<p>
The laughter increased. “Legends, superstitions,
fancies,” I heard in the midst of the hilarity.
</p>

<p>
I was so bewildered I didn’t know whether to get
angry or laugh with them.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I felt a touch on my shoulder. I turned
to see an officer looking attentively at me. “My name
is Tasa. Let me feel your pulse. Show me your
tongue. I recommend a little ice on the head.”

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
